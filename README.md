# INH Project

This project is a personal application designed to help find available rooms in my school. It uses a combination of Python, HTML/CSS/JS, AJAX requests, JSON files, and Dockerfile to achieve its functionality.

## Features

The system can be used in two distinct ways:

1. **Integration with Other Applications**:  
   You can send requests to this system to retrieve room availability data from JSON files. This facilitates integration with other applications under development, enabling them to exploit the information via a cloud computing platform.

2. **Automatic Web Page Display**:  
   The system can also automatically display room availability on a web page. This user-friendly interface makes it easy to check which rooms are available at any given time.

## Benefits
